We try to analyse the impact of several parametrs on Survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.
These Parameters include Age of patient at time of operation,
Patient's year of operation and
Number of positive axillary nodes detected.
Such an analysis could prove to be useful in predicting the chances of survival of a patient suffering through beast cancer.
